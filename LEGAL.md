# To contribute you (or your legal guardian) must agree to the SpaceKobold CLA
Found here: http://cla.spacekoboldgames.com
Non-legalese summary of the terms of this agreement (This is not a replacement for reading the agreement):
- The CLA only applies to *your original contributions*, not works submitted under an approved license or other negotiated license.
- **You keep your copyright for <u>your contribution</u>**, and grant us *the same rights to use your contribution*. Please note this does not grant you any rights to *the project as a whole* outside of those specified in the project license.
- You have a legal right to attribution (moral rights) in the credits of the project, please tell us if you wish to opt out of being displayed in the credits or wish to use an alternative name.
- If you patent or have patented any parts of your contribution, you give us the right to those use those patents in respect to the project.
- As much as possible, you are protected from legal liability from contributing (This does not protect you against copyright infringement liability).
- Any legal proceedings related to the CLA will be governed by Canadian law.
- The CLA may be amended with 30 days of notice by email. *If you do not agree to the new CLA your contributions will be kept under the old version.*

# Licensing/Attribution:
- Unless specified otherwise, all Assets, Code, or Content inside any _AlphaParadox folder, fall under the terms specified in AP-LICENSE.txt and the Space Kobold Games CLA (SpaceKoboldGames.com/legal/CLA-Individual).
- Any content from SpaceWizards/SpaceStation14 without specified licensing any code is licensed under MIT (LICENSE.txt). Any Space Wizards content licensed under CC-BY-SA to Space Wizards Federation & Contributors.
- You may not apply secondary licenses to SpaceKobolds/AlphaParadox code/content (MPL Exhibit-B) without written permission from Space Kobolds (in this case we will grant you a separate license). This is to make sure that Alpha-Paradox's code is available to be improved by the community and prevent further fragmenting the community due to license conflicts.

# Non-Permitted licenses:
The following licenses are not permitted to be used in this project:
- Any "strong" Copyleft or GPL derivative licenses: GPL, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL, etc. (This conflicts with the no secondary license provision of the MPL)
- Any license with strict or ambiguous "commercial use" restrictions: Any CC-BY-NC, Commons Clause, etc.
- Any Creative commons license *before* version 4.0 without permission from the original author

# Attribution/Sourcing Requirements:
- All assets *must* be properly licensed, attributed and include the original title of the work. This also requires a link to the original author, license and if needed provide a way to contact the author.
- For audio files especially: **you must find the actual author not just a youtube channel**. <u>If you cannot find the author/original license you cannot use the asset.</u> Failure to be able to provide sourcing information will result in your PR being closed, and potentially barring from future contributions depending on the severity of the situation.
- License versioning is important, make sure to include the correct version of the license in your attribution. If a version is not specified by the author with a versioned license, that is not a valid license and cannot be used.
- "No Derivatives" licenses should be avoided if possible (but are permitted) as they can prevent fixing bugs or making for accessibility reasons (Color blindness or epilepsy fixes, etc.).
