# Suggestions for sourcing art/audio assets:
Keep in mind that these are just suggestions to save you time, make sure to double check attribution/licensing and properly source your files.
## "Good" Sources for assets:
- https://freesound.org/

## "Bad" Sources for assets:
- *Most* "royalty free/creative commons" sound channels on youtube. Unless they have an off-site presence and/or link to a professional portfolio or site, do not use as the assets are very likely stolen and illegally relicensed.

# TODO: Fill out the rest of this
